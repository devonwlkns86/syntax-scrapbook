## 🐍 Python

### 🔁 For Loop

```python
for item in my_list:
    print(item)




4. Scroll down, type a **commit message** like:

Then click **Commit changes** (green button).

That’s it! You’ve just:
- Created your first GitHub repo ✅  
- Edited a file ✅  
- Made your first commit ✅  

When you're ready, we can:
- Add a folder structure (like `python/`, `js/`, etc.)
- Sync this with your local machine (using Git)
- Or just keep building it right on GitHub for now

Would you like to add a JavaScript example next, or create a folder for organizing multiple files?
